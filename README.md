# Project Alliance

FYI, ChatGPT generated README.md :D

## Description

**Project Alliance** is an experimental AI system designed to iteratively improve its own source code. Built on top of ChatGPT, this project explores controlled self-modification, allowing the AI to refine its performance, optimize auxiliary functions, and enhance specific algorithms while maintaining security and stability.

## Features

- 🚀 **Modular Self-Improvement:** AI can modify predefined sections of its own code while ensuring safety.
- ⚡ **Automated Performance Tuning:** Iterative optimization of non-critical components.
- 🔄 **Version Control & Rollback:** Tracks changes to prevent regressions and maintain stability.
- 🔒 **Security-Focused Design:** Self-modification is sandboxed to avoid unintended consequences.

## Goals

- 🏗️ Develop a safe and efficient framework for self-improving AI.
- ✅ Implement robust validation mechanisms for AI-generated modifications.
- 🌍 Explore real-world applications in automation, optimization, and adaptive systems.
